Description: Scalable implementation of generalized mixed models with highly
        optimized C++ implementation and integration with Genomic Data Structure
        (GDS) files. It is designed for single variant tests and set-based
        aggregate tests in large-scale Phenome-wide Association Studies (PheWAS)
        with millions of variants and samples, controlling for sample structure
        and case-control imbalance. The implementation is based on the SAIGE R
        package (v0.45, Zhou et al. 2018 and Zhou et al. 2020), and it is
        extended to include the state-of-the-art ACAT-O set-based tests.
        Benchmarks show that SAIGEgds is significantly faster than the SAIGE R
        package.
